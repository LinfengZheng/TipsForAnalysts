# TipsForAnalysts

Hi, welcome to Tony's tips for data analysts! Check out my videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jcYBZ2LPu4).

I've been a data analyst at a tech company in San Francisco since I earned a Master's degree in Business Analytics. In my YouTube channel I'm sharing tricks and tips for some data analysis tools like Google Big Query, Tableau, Google DataStudio, and GitHub. I spent a lot of time in my work trying to figure out how to use analytical tools more efficiently and with all those times I spend I got some tricks that will hopefully increase the efficiency of analyzing data with these tools. I hope you will find them useful!

If you find some interesting features that you'd like me to talk about, please email me at [tonystipsforanalysts@gmail.com](tonystipsforanalysts@gmail.com), or comment below my videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jcYBZ2LPu4). Thank you!
